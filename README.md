# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game in C

This is a simple **console-based Tic Tac Toe game** written in the C programming language. It allows **two players** to take turns on a **3×3 grid**, trying to win by placing three of their marks in a row—either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## 📌 Features

- 2-player turn-based gameplay.
- Simple text-based interface.
- Win and draw condition checks.
- Input validation (invalid or taken spots).

---

## 💡 Concepts Used

- **2D Arrays** for board representation.
- **Functions** for modular logic.
- **Loops and Conditionals** for game control flow.
- **User Input** with `scanf()`.

## 🕹 How to Play

1. Compile the code using any C compiler (GCC / Turbo C).
2. Run the program.
3. Each player enters a number (1–9) corresponding to a cell.
4. The board updates with `X` or `O`.
5. The game announces a win or draw when conditions are met.
